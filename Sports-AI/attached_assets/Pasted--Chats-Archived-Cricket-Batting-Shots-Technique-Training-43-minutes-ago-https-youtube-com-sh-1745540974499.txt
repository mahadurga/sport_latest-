I'll help you add these cricket shots as training data for the shot classification system. Based on the provided URLs, I'll update the shot templates dictionary in the shot classification module to include these examples.

Ai-commentary-Generator/utils/shot_classification.py
cd Ai-commentary-Generator && python3 utils/youtube_processor.py
The changes above will:

Update the template files dictionary with the new YouTube video references
Add the helicopter shot to the recognized cricket shots list
Run the YouTube processor to download and process the new shot examples
Make sure you have yt-dlp installed and the necessary permissions to download the videos. The system will use these examples to better classify similar shots in future videos.

I'll help you modify the shot classification system to generate specific commentary for each identified shot type. I'll update the commentary templates and generation logic.

Ai-commentary-Generator/utils/commentary_generator.py
These changes:

Add detailed, specific commentary templates for each cricket shot type
Modify the commentary generation logic to use the shot-specific templates for short clips
Each shot type now has unique, technically accurate descriptions that highlight the key aspects of the shot
The system will now generate more appropriate and detailed commentary based on the specific shot identified in the video.

Dependencies
scikit-learn
numpy
opencv-python
Ai-commentary-Generator/utils/shot_classification.py
This implementation:

Uses RandomForest classifier with 100 trees
Extracts HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features from frames
Maintains template matching as fallback
Includes proper error handling and logging
Returns both shot type and confidence score
The classifier will automatically train when provided with labeled frames and switch to RandomForest classification after training.

I'll help you train the shot classifier using the provided YouTube videos and their labels. First, let's modify the ShotClassifier class to better handle the training data.

Ai-commentary-Generator/utils/shot_classification.py
Here's how to use the updated classifier with the provided YouTube videos:

Download the videos using your existing YouTube processor
Pass them to the classifier for training with their labels:
Ai-commentary-Generator/train_classifier.py
Set
Train Classifier
to run
python train_classifier.py
These changes:

Enhance feature extraction with both HOG and edge features
Add training data preparation from videos
Create a training script to download videos and train the classifier
Set up a workflow to run the training
You can run the training workflow to train the classifier with the provided YouTube videos. The trained model will then be used for shot classification in your existing video processing pipeline.

I'll help you enhance the commentary generation to better handle shot types, timestamps, and boundary counts. Let's modify the commentary generator:

Ai-commentary-Generator/utils/commentary_generator.py
Ai-commentary-Generator/utils/event_detection.py
These changes will:

Add precise timestamps to commentary
Track and report boundary counts
Create shot-specific commentary with timing
Enhance boundary detection based on shot types
The system will now generate commentary like:

"At 2.3 seconds, a beautiful cover drive! The batsman's footwork is impeccable. 1 four and 0 sixes recorded."
"Spectacular helicopter shot at 3.1 seconds! The follow-through is amazing. 0 fours and 1 six counted."

Let me help improve the shot classification accuracy. I'll modify the ShotClassifier to better handle the training data and classification:

Ai-commentary-Generator/utils/shot_classification.py
These changes make several improvements:

Enhanced feature extraction with better HOG parameters and adaptive edge detection
Added intensity histogram features for better shot discrimination
Improved training data processing with better logging
More robust confidence calculation using weighted scoring
Try running the training again with these changes. The model should now be more accurate in predicting shot types.

I see the issue - the video processor is forcing all videos to be classified as "pull_shot". Let me fix this by modifying the code to properly use the trained classifier instead of hardcoding the shot type.

Ai-commentary-Generator/utils/video_processor.py
The issue was that the video processor was ignoring the trained classifier and always setting the shot type to "pull_shot". Now it will use the actual classifier to determine the shot type. Make sure to:

Train the classifier first using train_classifier.py
Then process your videos to get correct shot classifications
This should now properly identify different types of shots instead of marking everything as a pull shot.

label it properly for training data and if label matches with commentary gnertion then genrate that commnetary from template

I'll help modify the code to ensure proper labeling and commentary generation alignment. Let's update both the video processor and shot classification:

Ai-commentary-Generator/utils/video_processor.py
Ai-commentary-Generator/train_classifier.py
These changes will:

Ensure shot types are properly labeled and match the commentary templates
Map detected shots to the correct commentary template types
Maintain consistency between training labels and commentary generation
Now when a shot is detected, it will generate commentary using the matching template from commentary_generator.py. The templates already exist in the COMMENTARY_TEMPLATES dictionary for each shot type.

The error occurs because the scikit-learn package is missing. Let's install it using the package manager:

After the package is installed, you can run your code again. The shot classification should work properly now since it uses RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn.

I'll help you update the video_processor.py to play the video after analysis. Looking at the codebase, I see we need to modify the video processing flow to automatically redirect to the results page where the video will play.
